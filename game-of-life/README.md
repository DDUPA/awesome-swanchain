# Conway’s Game of Life

Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player cellular automaton invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The initial state of the game is determined by the positions of the live cells, which then evolve according to the following rules:

Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors remains alive in the next generation.
Death: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies in the next generation, due to overpopulation.
Death: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies in the next generation, due to underpopulation.
Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation.
The Game of Life is remarkable because, despite its simple rules, it can produce incredibly complex patterns, which can be static and stable structures, as well as moving and constantly changing patterns. These patterns, sometimes referred to as “biomorphs,” can exhibit behaviors akin to biological evolution, such as reproduction, death, and competition.

Conway’s Game of Life is not only a mathematical amusement but also has wide applications in fields such as computer science, complexity theory, and artificial life. It demonstrates that even the simplest systems can generate unpredictable and complex dynamics.
