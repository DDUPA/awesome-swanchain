# DOS-Game

DOS-GAME, also known as Disk Operating System games, refers to the computer games popular from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s that were based on the DOS operating system. These games typically had simple graphics and basic sound effects, but they often showcased high levels of creativity and appeal in terms of gameplay and storytelling. During that era, DOS-GAME provided players with countless classic gaming experiences, such as “The Legend of Sword and Fairy,” “Xuan-Yuan Sword,” “Command & Conquer,” and “Warcraft.”
